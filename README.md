# SWITEST

Switest lets you write functional tests for your voice applications,
using Adhearsion to drive calls via FreeSWITCH.

## Example

To test your fancy new PBX and its phone menu, you could write the
following Switest scenario, which dials your number, presses "1"
and checks that Bob was called as a result of that:

```ruby
# test/scenario/pbx_scenario.rb

require "switest"
require "switest/autorun"

class PbxScenario < Switest::Scenario
  def test_dial_and_press_1
    # First we make an outbound call. All parameters are passed
    # directly to `Adhearsion::OutboundCall#dial`.
    alice = Agent.dial("sofia/gateway/your-provider/88888888")

    # We set up an agent that will listen for inbound calls.
    # All parameters are HasGuardedHandlers guards.
    bob = Agent.listen_for_call(to: /^22334455@/)

    # Wait until the call has been answered by the PBX.
    alice.wait_for_answer

    # Send a DTMF
    alice.send_dtmf("1")

    # Check that the call to Bob has already arrived, or wait
    # up to five seconds for it to arrive.
    assert_call(bob)
  end
end
```

```
ruby test/scenario/pbx_scenario.rb
```

Or you might want to test that you can call Bob, and that Bob can
transfer the call to Charlie by pressing "#1#":

```ruby
# test/scenario/transfer_scenario.rb

require "switest"
require "switest/autorun"

class TransferScenario < Switest::Scenario
  def test_transfer_call
    bob = Agent.listen_for_call to: /^1000@/
    alice = Agent.dial("sofia/gateway/your-provider/1000")
    
    assert_call(bob)
    
    charlie = Agent.listen_for_call to: /^2000@/
    
    bob.answer
    sleep 1
    bob.send_dtmf("#1#")
    
    assert_call(charlie)
    assert_hungup(bob)

    charlie.hangup
  end
end
```

## Configuration

You need:

1. FreeSWITCH instance with `mod_rayo` configured
2. Sofia profile for Switest
3. The following dialplan for the Switest profile:
    
    ```xml
    <context name="switest">
      <extension name="switest">
        <condition>
          <action application="rayo" data="switest"/>
        </condition>
      </extension>
    </context>
    ```

## Provided assertions

`Switest::Scenario` inherits from `Minitest::Test`, so all your regular
assertions are available. Switest provides a few custom assertions:

* `assert_call`
* `assert_no_call`
* `assert_hungup`
* `assert_not_hungup`
* `assert_dtmf`

## Limitations

### DTMF

Due to limitations in `mod_rayo` the only way to send a DTMF at the
moment, is by playing the tones, so the endpoint you are testing
must support inband DTMF for the DTMF features to work.

### Early stage

This is prototype software, but still quite powerful. At the moment
it is running 50+ scenarios at Relatel, testing everything from
IVR menus to attended transfers and voicemails.
